* We need to build a chatbot.
  - The main idea is that the user asks a question, and the chatbot gives an answer.

1 We need to build a UI (user interface) that allows the user to enter a question.
  - This UI will be built using JavaScript (JS).
  - The UI should also display the chatbot's answer.

2 The answer will come from an AI model, but we need a way to connect the AI to the UI.
  - This is where the HTTP server comes in.

3 We will build this server using Python with Flask.
  - The server’s job is to receive the user’s question, send it to the AI, and return the answer to the UI.

4 The server will use an AI model from Hugging Face Transformers (specifically, DistilGPT-2) to generate the answer.



to achive 1 we need to lean this :
    1. basics HTML (HTML is used to create the structure of the page.)
        - How to create:
            a text input box for the user to ask a question
            a button to send the question
            a div or similar area to display the chatbot's answer    
        - you can use basic CSS (optional, just for styling)
    2. Vanilla JavaScript
        - how to get the value from the input box when the user clicks the button
        - how to send that value to the server using fetch() (this is the most important thing that we will learn)
        - how to handle the response from the server
        - How to update the page with the answer  
    3. Basic DOM Manipulation (to show the chatbot’s answer)
        - select HTML elements using JS (document.getElementById())
        - change their content (element.innerText = 'answer')  
to achive 2 and 3 we need to lean this :
    1. Basic Python
       - Define functions
       - Work with strings
       - Import and use Python packages 
    2. Virtual Environments and pip
        - How to create a virtual environment:
            python3 -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
        - How to install packages using pip:
            pip install flask transformers torch python-dotenv
    3. Flask (Web Framework)
        - making the http server which will handle:
            Receiving HTTP requests (e.g. from the frontend)
            Running your Python code to process the request
            Sending a response back (usually in JSON)
        - Learn how to:
            Create a basic Flask app
            Define routes like /ask
            Return JSON responses using jsonify() 
to achive 4 we need to lean this :
    1. understanding what is (Hugging Face Transformers)
        - It’s a Python library that gives access to many powerful AI models like ()
        - It allows us to easily load and use pre-trained models for tasks like:
            text generation
            question answering        
    2. how to use it
        - The pipeline() function form HFT gives us a simple way to use AI models
            generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="distilgpt2")
            result = generator("What is 42Amman?", max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)
            4. How to integrate the AI with Flask


*****if you notice there are no mention for torch lib*****
so i asked the manager -> now i want to ask you what about the torch lib do i need it ??? 
the manager answer -> 
Why Do You Need torch?
The Hugging Face Transformers library uses deep learning models, and most of those models (like DistilGPT-2) are built on top of PyTorch.
    ⚙️ torch = PyTorch, a powerful machine learning library that runs the neural network (the brain of the AI).
Even though you won’t write code using torch directly, the Transformers library depends on it under the hood to:
    Load the neural network model
    Do the actual calculations to generate answers
    Use the computer’s CPU or GPU efficiently
