* what is HTML and why do we need it ?
    - It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
    - and we need it to build our to build the basic look for our app
    - also we need it because the browsers understand it

* ok now how to start
    - to start you first need a file end with (.html) and a browser
        why do i need a browser ? you need a browser to change the show you your html result 
    - remember that the html file is in your computer and the browser can get it esaly
        don't get confuse about how does the web page opened without need for a server
        like what we did in netpractice, now we have the html file local that's why
        we don't need a server (the server job is to send to you the html files)
        but sure if we want to open a page in the intrnet then we need a server and the in
        of this server to let him send to us the html files and then the browser can run them 

* how to write html
    - now after we made a html file and opened it with browser now how or what to write
        in html we are using something called (tag) now this tags tell the browser "how to display content"
    - don't get confuse between flutter widgets(tell's flutter "what to display") 
        with html tags (tells the browser "how to display") 
    - example (<h1>hello world</h1>)  this tells the browser the display hello "world" content like it is 
        a header (make it big and bold) there are alot more tags like  <strong> -> let the contant bold
        <small>make the text small, <a> let the text be a link and most of them work this way
        but it is limited like what if i want to make the contant with less bold and with red color(her comes CSS)
    - but befor start writing your code there a somethings that you need to write befor everything and it is mandatory
        (like the run app and material app in flutter),  first <!DOCTYPE html> thats tell's the browser what the type 
        of html that i am using we will use (html5) then there should be a <html> tag and in side this tag 
        will be to main tags <head> and <body> the <head> tag will be for the meta data (the things that you will not see)
        and the <body> tag will be for everything that you will but in the screen (will centin all the tags)
