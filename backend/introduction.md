* now after doing the front and understood that now we need to build a server.
* to build a server we will use a flask python lib which will build to us the server
* after building the server now we need to use something called route
	- what is the route ? we build he server right? and now the front can send and
	recive form this sever right ?
	- no thats not how it works the server use the thing that called route to recive a
	requset and answer that requset
	- so the fornt will send a requset to the route (part of the server) and the route will chose what to send back to the front
	- we will build the route using flask
